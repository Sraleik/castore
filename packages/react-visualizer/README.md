# React Visualizer

React component to visualize, design and manually test [Castore](https://github.com/castore-dev/castore) event stores and commands.

## 📥 Installation

This package has `@castore/core`, `@castore/json-schema-command` and `react` (above v17) as peer dependencies, so you will have to install them as well:

```
