# HTTP Event Storage Adapter

DRY Castore [`EventStorageAdapter`](https://github.com/castore-dev/castore/#--eventstorageadapter) implementation using a HTTP API.

This class is mainly useful for manual and unit tests. It is obviously not recommended for production uses 🙂

## 📥 Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @castore/http-event-storage-adapter

# yarn
yarn add @castore/http-event-storage-adapter
```

This package has `@castore/core` as peer dependency, so you will have to install it as well:

# npm
npm install @castore/core

# yarn
yarn add @castore/core
```
