# ðŸ“– Read Models

Even with snapshots, using the event store for querying needs (like displaying data in a web page) would be slow and inefficient, if not impossible depending on the access pattern.

In Event Sourcing, it is common to use a special type of message bus listener called **projections**, responsible for maintaining data specifically designed for querying needs, called **read models**.

Read models allow for faster read operations, as well as re-indexing. Keep in mind that they are [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) by design, which can be annoying in some use cases (like opening a resource page directly after its creation).

Read models are not implemented in Castore yet, but we have big plans for them, so stay tuned ðŸ™‚
