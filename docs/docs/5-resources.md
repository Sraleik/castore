## Test Tools

Castore comes with a handy [Test Tool package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/test-tools) that facilitates the writing of unit tests: It allows mocking event stores, populating them with an initial state and resetting them to it in a boilerplate-free and type-safe way.

## Dam

[Dam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/dam) is a suite of utils that facilitates data migration and maintenance operations with Castore (for instance, dispatching all the events of an event store - ordered by their timestamps - to a message queue).

## React Visualizer

Castore also comes with a handy [React Visualizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@castore/react-visualizer) library: It exposes a React component to visualize, design and manually test Castore event stores and commands.
