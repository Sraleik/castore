# Making Event Sourcing easy 😎

[Event Sourcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) is a data storage paradigm that saves **changes in your application state** rather than the state itself.

It is powerful as it enables **rewinding to a previous state** and **exploring audit trails** for debugging or business/legal purposes. It also integrates very well with [event-driven architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture).

However, it is **tricky to implement** 😅

<!-- TODO: SCHEMA OF EVENT SOURCING -->

After years of using it at [Kumo](https://dev.to/kumo), we have grown to love it, but also experienced first-hand the lack of consensus and tooling around it. That's where Castore comes from!

---

<p align="center">
  Castore is a TypeScript library that <b>makes Event Sourcing easy</b> 😎
</p>

---

With Castore, you'll be able to:

- Define your [event stores](#-eventstore)
- Fetch and push new [events](#-events) seamlessly
- Implement and test your [commands](#%EF%B8%8F-command)
- ...and much more!

All that with first-class developer experience and minimal boilerplate ✨

## 🫀 Core Design

Some important decisions that we've made early on:

### 💭 **Abstractions first**

Castore has been designed with **flexibility** in mind. It gives you abstractions that are meant to be used **anywhere**: React apps, containers, Lambdas... you name it!

For instance, `EventStore` classes are **stack agnostic**: They need an `EventStorageAdapter` class to interact with actual data. You can code your own `EventStorageAdapter` (simply implement the interface), but it's much simpler to use an off-the-shelf adapter like [`DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter`](./packages/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/README.md).

### 🙅‍♂️ **We do NOT deploy resources**

While some packages like `DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter` require compatible infrastructure, Castore is not responsible for deploying it.

Though that is not something we exclude in the future, we are a small team and decided to focus on DevX first.

### ⛑ **Full type safety**

Speaking of DevX, we absolutely love TypeScript! If you do too, you're in the right place: We push type-safety to the limit in everything we do!

If you don't, that's fine 👍 Castore is still available in Node/JS. And you can still profit from some nice JSDocs!

### 📖 **Best practices**

The Event Sourcing journey has many hidden pitfalls. We ran into them for you!

Castore is opiniated. It comes with a collection of best practices and documented anti-patterns that we hope will help you out!

## Getting Started

### 📥 Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @castore/core

# yarn
yarn add @castore/core
```

### 📦 Packages structure

Castore is not a single package, but a **collection of packages** revolving around a `core` package. This is made so every line of code added to your project is _opt-in_, wether you use tree-shaking or not.

Castore packages are **released together**. Though different versions may be compatible, you are **guaranteed** to have working code as long as you use matching versions.

Here is an example of working `package.json`:

```js
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@castore/core": "1.3.1",
    "@castore/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter": "1.3.1"
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@castore/test-tools": "1.3.1"
    ...
  }
}
```

## The Basics

### 📚 `Events`

Event Sourcing is all about **saving changes in your application state**. Such changes are represented by **events**, and needless to say, they are quite important 🙃

Events that concern the same business entity (like a `User`) are aggregated through a common id called `aggregateId` (and vice versa, events that have the same `aggregateId` represent changes of the same business entity). The index of an event in such a serie of events is called its `version`.

In Castore, stored events (also called **event details**) always have exactly the following properties:

- <code>aggregateId <i>(string)</i></code>
- <code>version <i>(integer ≥ 1)</i></code>
- <code>timestamp <i>(string)</i></code>: A date in ISO 8601 format
- <code>type <i>(string)</i></code>: A string identifying the business meaning of the event
- <code>payload <i>(?any = never)</i></code>: A payload of any type
- <code>metadata <i>(?any = never)</i></code>: Some metadata of any type

```ts
import type { EventDetail } from '@castore/core';

type UserCreatedEventDetail = EventDetail<
  'USER_CREATED',
  { name: string; age: number },
  { invitedBy?: string }
>;

// 👇 Equivalent to:
type UserCreatedEventDetail = {
  aggregateId: string;
  version: number;
  timestamp: string;
  type: 'USER_CREATED';
  payload: { name: string; age: number };
  metadata: { invitedBy?: string };
};
```

### 🏷 `EventType`

Events are generally classified in **events types** (not to confuse with TS types). Castore lets you declare them via the `EventType` class:

```ts
import { EventType } from '@castore/core';

const userCreatedEventType = new EventType<
  'USER_CREATED',
  { name: string; age: number },
  { invitedBy?: string }
>({ type: 'USER_CREATED' });
```

Note that we only provided TS types for `payload` and `metadata` properties. That is because, as stated in the [core design](#🫀-core-design), **Castore is meant to be as flexible as possible**, and that includes the validation library you want to use: The `EventType` class is not meant to be used directly, but rather implemented by other classes which will add run-time validation methods to it 👍

>   [typeof userCreatedEventType, typeof userRemovedEventType]
> >;
> // => EventTypeDetail<typeof userCreatedEventType>
> // | EventTypeDetail<typeof userRemovedEventType>
> ```
>
> </details>

### 🏗 `Aggregate`

Eventhough entities are stored as series of events, we still want to use a **stable interface to represent their states at a point in time** rather than directly using events. In Castore, it is implemented by a TS type called `Aggregate`.

> ☝️ Think of aggregates as _"what the data would look like in CRUD"_

In Castore, aggregates necessarily contain an `aggregateId` and `version` properties (the `version` of the latest `event`). But for the rest, it's up to you 🤷‍♂️

For instance, we can include a `name`, `age` and `status` properties to our `UserAggregate`:

```ts
import type { Aggregate } from '@castore/core';

// Represents a User at a point in time
interface UserAggregate extends Aggregate {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  status: 'CREATED' | 'REMOVED';
}

// 👇 Equivalent to:
interface UserAggregate {
  aggregateId: string;
  version: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  status: 'CREATED' | 'REMOVED';
}
```

### ⚙️ `Reducer`

Aggregates are derived from their events by [reducing them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) through a `reducer` function. It defines **how to update the aggregate when a new event is pushed**:

<!-- TODO: SCHEMA OF EVENTS AGGREGATE -->

```ts
import type { Reducer } from '@castore/core';

const usersReducer: Reducer<UserAggregate, UserEventsDetails> = (
  userAggregate,
  newEvent,
) => {
  const { version, aggregateId } = newEvent;

  switch (newEvent.type) {
    case 'USER_CREATED': {
      const { name, age } = newEvent.payload;

      // 👇 Return the next version of the aggregate
      return {
        aggregateId,
        version,
        name,
        age,
        status: 'CREATED',
      };
    }
    case 'USER_REMOVED':
      return { ...userAggregate, version, status: 'REMOVED' };
  }
};

const johnDowAggregate: UserAggregate = johnDowEvents.reduce(usersReducer);
```

> ☝️ Aggregates are always **computed on the fly**, and NOT stored. Changing them does not require any data migration whatsoever.

### 🎁 `EventStore`

Once you've defined your [event types](#-eventtype) and how to [aggregate](#%EF%B8%8F-reducer) them, you can bundle them together in an `EventStore` class.

Each event store in your application represents a business entity. Think of event stores as _"what tables would be in CRUD"_, except that instead of directly updating data, you just append new events to it!

In Castore, `EventStore` classes are NOT responsible for actually storing data (this will come with [event storage adapters](#-eventstorageadapter)). But rather to provide a boilerplate-free and type-safe interface to perform many actions such as:

- Listing aggregate ids
- Accessing events of an aggregate
- Building an aggregate with the reducer
- Pushing new events etc...

```ts
import { EventStore } from '@castore/core';

const userEventStore = new EventStore({
  eventStoreId: 'USERS',
  eventStoreEvents: [
    userCreatedEventType,
    userRemovedEventType,
    ...
  ],
  reduce: usersReducer,
});
// ...and that's it 🥳
```

> ☝️ The `EventStore` class is the heart of Castore, it even gave it its name!

### 💾 `EventStorageAdapter`

For the moment, we didn't provide any actual way to store our events data. This is the responsibility of the `EventStorageAdapter` class.

```ts
import { EventStore } from '@castore/core';

const userEventStore = new EventStore({
  eventStoreId: 'USERS',
  eventTypes: userEventTypes,
  reducer: usersReducer,
  // 👇 Provide it in the constructor
  storageAdapter: mySuperStorageAdapter,
});

// 👇 ...or set/switch it in context later
userEventStore.storageAdapter = mySuperStorageAdapter;
```

You can choose to [build an event storage adapter](./docs/building-your-own-event-storage-adapter.md) that suits your usage. However, we highly recommend using an off-the-shelf adapter:

- [DynamoDB Event Storage Adapter](./packages/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/README.md)
- [Redux Event Storage Adapter](./packages/redux-event-storage-adapter/README.md)
- [In-Memory Event Storage Adapter](./packages/inmemory-event-storage-adapter/README.md)

If the storage solution that you use is missing, feel free to create/upvote an issue, or contribute!

### ✍️ `Command`

Modifying the state of your application (i.e. pushing new events to your event stores) is done by executing **commands**. They typically consist in:

- Fetching the required aggregates (if not the first event of a new aggregate)
- Validating that the modification is acceptable
- Pushing new events with incremented versions

<!-- TODO, add schema -->

```ts
import { Command, tuple } from '@castore/core';

type Input = { name: string; age: number };
type Output = { userId: string };
type Context = { generateUuid: () => string };

const createUserCommand = new Command({
  commandId: 'CREATE_USER',
  // 👇 "tuple" is needed to keep ordering in inferred type
  requiredEventStores: tuple(userEventStore, otherEventStore),
  // 👇 Code to execute
  handler: async (
    commandInput: Input,
    [userEventStore, otherEventStore],
    // 👇 Additional context arguments can be provided
    { generateUuid }: Context,
  ): Promise<Output> => {
    const { name, age } = commandInput;
    const userId = generateUuid();

    await userEventStore.pushEvent({
      aggregateId: userId,
      version: 1,
      type: 'USER_CREATED',
      payload: { name, age },
    });

    return { userId };
  },
});
```

Note that we only provided TS types for `Input` and `Output` properties. That is because, as stated in the [core design](#🫀-core-design), **Castore is meant to be as flexible as possible**, and that includes the validation library you want to use: The `Command` class is not meant to be used directly, but rather extended by other classes which will add run-time validation methods to it 👍

> ]);
> ```

> </details>

A few notes on commands handlers:

- `Commands` handlers should NOT use [read models](#📖-read-models) when validating that a modification is acceptable. Read models are like cache: They are not the source of truth, and may not represent the freshest state.

- Fetching and pushing events non-simultaneously exposes your application to [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). To counter that, commands are designed to be retried when an `EventAlreadyExistsError` is triggered (which is part of the `EventStorageAdapter` interface).

- Command handlers should be, as much as possible, [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). If it depends on impure functions like functions with unpredictable outputs (like id generation), mutating effects, side effects or state dependency (like external data fetching), you should pass them through the additional context arguments rather than directly importing and using them. This will make them easier to test and to re-use in different contexts, such as in the [React Visualizer](./packages/react-visualizer/README.md).

- Finally, when writing on several event stores at once, it is important to make sure that **all events are written or none**, i.e. use transactions: This ensures that the application is not in a corrupt state. Transactions accross event stores cannot be easily abstracted, so check you adapter library on how to achieve this. For instance, the [`DynamoDBEventStorageAdapter`](./packages/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/README.md) exposes a [`pushEventsTransaction`](./packages/dynamodb-event-storage-adapter/src/utils/pushEventsTransaction.ts) util.

### 📨 Message Buses & Queues

As mentioned in the introduction, Event Sourcing integrates very well with [event-driven architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture). After having successfully run a command, it can be very useful to push the freshly written events in a [Message Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) or a [Message Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue) system.

There are two kind of messages:

- **Notification messages** which only carry the events details
- **Stateful messages** which also carry the corresponding aggregates

<!-- TODO, add schema -->

Message buses and queues are not implemented in Castore yet, but we have big plans for them, so stay tuned 🙂

### 📸 Snapshots

As events pile up in your event stores, the performances and costs of your commands can become an issue.

One solution is to periodially persist **snapshots** of your aggregates (e.g. through a message bus subscription), and only fetch them plus the subsequent events instead of all the events.

Snapshots are not implemented in Castore yet, but we have big plans for them, so stay tuned 🙂

### 📖 Read Models

Even with snapshots, using the event store for querying needs (like displaying data in a web page) would be slow and inefficient, if not impossible depending on the access pattern.

In Event Sourcing, it is common to use a special type of message bus subscription called **projections**, responsible for maintaining data specifically designed for querying needs, called **read models**.

Read models allow for faster read operations and re-indexing. Keep in mind that they are [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) by design, which can be annoying in some use cases (like opening a resource page directly after its creation).

Read models are not implemented in Castore yet, but we have big plans for them, so stay tuned 🙂

## Resources

### 🎯 Test Tools

Castore comes with a handy [Test Tool package](./packages/test-tools/README.md) that facilitates the writing of unit tests: It allows mocking event stores, populating them with an initial state and resetting them to it in a boilerplate-free and type-safe way.

### 🌈 React Visualizer

Castore also comes with a handy [React Visualizer](./packages/react-visualizer/README.md) library: It exposes a React component to visualize, design and manually test Castore event stores and commands.
